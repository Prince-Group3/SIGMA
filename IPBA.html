      <h1>What is <span class="ph">Gen</span><span class="ph2">der</span> Inequality?:</h1>
      <p id="p"> It is the unequal treatment of people based on their own gender which can affect their opportunities, resources and even rights. This issue affects societies around the world that can intersect (divide) people such as their race, class, or even sexual orientation. Examples of this are the divide of chores, jobs and many more.  Gender equality is an essential human right and that right is violated by gender-based discrimination
</p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="head">BACKGROUND:</h1>
<p>Did you know that Gender Inequality can be seen in Neolithic or Copper Age excavation? During the Neolithic period, Men were seen with more power & dominance over women, this is because of the so-called gender roles. What are gender roles? Gender roles are the behavior, attitude, and actions that society expects from the person based on their sex. They are based on their cultural norms and traditions. Examples of gender roles include : </p>
<div>
  <ul>
     <li>Women are expected to be helpful, passive and kind to the people around them, They are seen as the “caregivers, helpers, and homemakers.</li>
     <li>Men are expected to be dominant,assertive, and strong. They are seen as the leaders and protectors.</li>
     <li>Gender roles are based on the different expectations of individuals, groups, and societies based on their gender and are based on each society's values and beliefs about their gender.</li> 
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>THESIS STATEMENT:</h1>
    <p>To achieve fairness in each gender, we need to challenge stereotypes (to question and confront widely held beliefs and assumptions about a particular group of people.), ensuring equal opportunities in education and even employment. This could also transform our culture to value everyone’s contribution and opinions. Only through these comprehensive measures can create a society where everyone has a fair chance to step-up.  And by “transforming”, we can try to support each gender organizations
</p>
    <h1>EXAMPLES OF DENIAL:</h1>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.humanrightscareers.com/magazine/organizations-gender-equality/">Gender Inequality</a> No. 1 that UN Women It supports the UN member states in achieving global standards of gender equality, and it works closely with civil society organizations and governments to design and implement policies, laws and services that benefit women.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Education: Gender inequality of education prevents both girls and boys, women and men from ensuring the basic human right to education. This phenomenon is a serious problem, although, nationally and internationally. Moreover, it has been a major challenge over past years and the struggle connected with it continues nowadays because its influence not only affects the lives of individuals but also inhibits the development of the whole society and thus harms economic growth. Depending on the place of occurrence, it can take various forms. What are the issues in Gender Inequality in education? Gender bias in education can significantly limit the career aspirations of students, particularly girls. Like when girls are exposed to gendered stereotypes and biases, they may internalize these messages and steer away from subjects and careers traditionally dominated by men, such as STEM fields, As the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/impact-gender-bias-education-emily-van-putten-jy14e#:~:text=Gender%20bias%20in%20education%20can,men%2C%20such%20as%20STEM%20fields.">Impact of Gender Inequality in education</a> said.</li>
  <li>Employment: Gender inequality in the workplace prevents creativity and productivity. Women's ideas and perspectives are overlooked When they are left out of decision-making and leadership roles. Example of Gender Inequality in Employment: Unequal pay for women, despite comparable job responsibilities and qualifications, represents a clear example of entrenched gender-based discrimination</li>
  <li>Political Participation:  How does Gender Inequality Affect Political Participation? It affects the Political because it often makes barriers to women and to other disadvantaged genders to engage equally in participating in the political process. It also limits opportunities, access, and more in the political system.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Impact of Denial:</h4>
<p>Gender inequality has extensive effects that harm individuals and societies. It limits growth as women often face problems with education, employment, and leadership. Many women are paid less than men for the same work or are restricted to low-paying jobs. Health outcomes are also affected. Limited access to healthcare and education about sexual health increases risks during childbirth and leaves many in danger to diseases. Education suffers, too, as girls in some regions face problems attending schools. This limits their future opportunities. These inequalities don’t just harm women, they also affect entire families and future generations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individual Impact:  How does it affect individuals? It affects individuals by limiting their opportunities and well-being. Like I said, Women often face problems with education and career growth. This can lead to poverty and dependence on others. Of course, Health is also affected, as many women lack access to quality healthcare. Unequal treatment can lower self-esteem and restrict personal freedom, as women may feel excluded from decision-making in their homes or communities. These effects not only harm women but also hold back society by wasting individual potential.</li>
  <li>Societal Impact: How does it affect the Society as a whole? As we all know, Gender Inequality affects us negatively of course because it limits economic growth, reinforces discrimination and ultimately deprives communities of the diverse contribution needed for progress and inclusivity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>THE SOLUTION:</h4>
<p>Gender inequality has a lot of possible solutions. What are the solutions to gender inequality? We can <strong>challenge gender stereotypes</strong>, How? For example, We can try women to do the work of men, while men do the work of women. The next solution is, <strong>Provide equal opportunities</strong>, we can provide equal opportunities by creating an inclusive environment where all employees feel valued and have equal opportunities to succeed. <strong>Empower women</strong>, How can we empower women? We can try coaching sessions to help women stay motivated and productive in their workspaces. We can also <strong>try being a mentor</strong> by volunteering our time to prevent violence by speaking to our peers/others.</p>
<h4>URGENCY TO ACTION:</h4>
<p>Gender inequality is a critical global issue that demands immediate attention as it hinders economic growth, societal progress, and individual well-being. The lack of equal opportunities for women in the workforce reduces global productivity, while barriers to education for millions of girls perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit their potential. Gender-based violence and discrimination continue to harm countless individuals, making it essential to act swiftly to safeguard human rights and dignity.</p>
<h4>HOPE AND PROGRESS:  positive developments or potential solutions.</h4>
<p>Despite the challenges, significant progress and promising solutions provide hope for overcoming gender inequality. Many countries have introduced policies promoting equal pay, education access, and protections against gender-based violence, reflecting positive strides toward equality. Global initiatives such as the Malala Fund have expanded access to education for girls, while technology is increasingly empowering women through access to jobs, education, and financial services.</p>
<h4>CALL TO ACTION:</h4>
<p>For the individual we can try by respecting our gender and we shouldn’t judge the disadvantaged genders, and for the society we can start by promoting education for all, ensuring equal access to quality education for all genders. Promote gender diversity in leadership and hiring.</p>
<h4>CONCLUSION:</h4>
<p>Gender Inequality is a global issue, It is a problem in every country in our world. Progress is possible, although progress is slow, It shows that change is possible. We can make this change possible by <strong>strengthening social protection and public service delivery, Supporting women’s representation, etc.</strong></p>
<h4>RESTATE THESIS:</h4>
<p>For this whole plan/solution to work we need for everyone of us to work together and make the world a better version of itself by not discriminating between each and one of us gender. After challenging stereotypes and ensuring equal opportunities in education and even employment, we now have progress on making each day better without discriminating genders.</p>
<h4>SUMMARIZE KEY POINTS:</h4>
<p>Our main point in this essay is for us to recognize what we've become for the past second century BCE, and we are pointing that this is the time for us to change and eliminate the systemic barriers that prevent individuals from having equal opportunities and rights based on this gender.</p>
<h4>ENDING MESSAGE:</h4>
<p>Gender doesn’t define who we truly are, make your life the dream you wanted it to be, doesn’t matter what your gender is, what matters is that we all have equality to ourselves and to other gender and respect to other disadvantaged gender. Now why don’t we create a better world where everyone stands equal? Gender Inequality won’t help us get ahead of ourselves, it won't change anything but it will break the gender that has disadvantages when it comes to employment, education, leadership and more.</p>
